    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds (approx. 1 kg) of beef, cut into chunks (common cuts include sirloin or ribeye)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Meat: <br><br>

            Rinse the meat chunks under cold water and pat them dry with a paper towel.
            Place the meat in a large bowl.<br>
        </li><br>
        <li>Season the Meat:<br><br>

            Sprinkle salt and black pepper over the meat, adjusting the quantities based on your taste preferences.
            Add minced garlic, grated ginger, and soy sauce (if using).
            Drizzle vegetable oil over the meat.
            Mix the ingredients well, ensuring the meat is evenly coated. You can use your hands for this step, but make sure they are clean.
        </li><br>
        <li>Marinate the Meat:<br><br>

            Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the meat to a sealed plastic bag.
            Allow the meat to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours. Marinating overnight will intensify the flavors.
        </li><br>
        <li>Preheat the Grill:<br><br>

            Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. You can use a charcoal grill for an authentic flavor, but a gas grill or an oven broiler will work as well.
        </li><br>
        <li>Skewer the Meat:<br><br>

            Thread the marinated meat onto skewers, leaving a little space between each piece for even cooking.
        </li><br>
        <li>Grill the Nyama Choma:<br><br>

            Place the skewers on the preheated grill and cook for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the meat is browned and cooked to your desired level of doneness.
        </li><br>
        <li>Serve:<br><br>

            Remove the Nyama Choma from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes.
            Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side. You can also serve it with a side of vegetables, salads, or your favorite dipping sauces.
        </li><br>
        <li>Enjoy:<br><br>

            Enjoy your Nyama Choma with friends and family. It's a social dish meant to be shared!

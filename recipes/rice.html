        Wali wa Nazi, also known as Coconut Rice, is a flavorful dish enjoyed in East Africa. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 can (14 oz) coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick (optional)</li>
        <li>3-4 whole cloves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the Rice:<br>

            Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Prepare the Coconut Mixture:<br>

            In a mixing bowl, combine the coconut milk and water. Mix well until the coconut milk is evenly distributed.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Sauté the Rice:<br>

            In a large pot or saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat.
            Add the rinsed rice to the pot and sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice is lightly toasted.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Add Coconut Mixture:<br>

            Pour the coconut milk and water mixture over the toasted rice. Stir in salt and add the cinnamon stick and whole cloves if using.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Bring to a Boil:<br>

            Bring the mixture to a gentle boil
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Reduce Heat and Simmer:<br>

            Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and has absorbed the liquid.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Check for Doneness:<br>

            Check the rice for doneness. If it's still a bit firm, you can add a little more water and continue to simmer until fully cooked.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Fluff and Serve:<br>

            Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork to separate the grains. Remove the cinnamon stick and whole cloves if used.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Serve Warm:<br>

            Serve the Wali wa Nazi warm as a side dish, pairing it with your favorite stews, grilled meats, or vegetables.
        </li><br><br>
    </ol>
    <p>
        For extra richness, you can add a few tablespoons of coconut cream to the cooking liquid.
        You can also add a bit of sugar if you prefer a slightly sweet flavor.
        Wali wa Nazi is a delicious accompaniment to various dishes and is often enjoyed as part of traditional East African meals. Adjust the seasoning and ingredients to suit your taste preferences.

    </p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup chickpea flour (besan)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice flour (optional, for extra crispiness)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro (coriander leaves)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water (adjust as needed)</li>
        <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Potatoes:<br>

            Peel and thinly slice the potatoes. You can use a mandolin or a knife to achieve thin, even slices.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Prepare the Batter:<br>

            In a mixing bowl, combine chickpea flour, rice flour (if using), cumin seeds, coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well.
            Gradually add water while stirring to form a smooth, lump-free batter. The consistency should be thick enough to coat the potato slices.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Add Cilantro:<br>

            Stir in the finely chopped cilantro into the batter.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Heat Oil:<br>

            Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium-high heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Coat Potato Slices:<br>

            Dip each potato slice into the batter, ensuring it's well coated.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Fry the Bhajias:<br>

            Carefully drop the coated potato slices into the hot oil. Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding.
            Fry until the bhajias turn golden brown and crispy. This usually takes about 3-4 minutes per batch.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Drain Excess Oil:<br>

            Use a slotted spoon to remove the fried bhajias and place them on paper towels to drain any excess oil.
        </li>Repeat:<br>

        Repeat the process until all the potato slices are coated and fried.<br><br>
        <li>Serve:<br>

            Serve the potato bhajias hot with your favorite chutney or sauce.</li><br><br>
    </ol>
    <p>
        You can add a pinch of baking soda to the batter for extra crispiness.
Experiment with other vegetables like onions, spinach, or cauliflower for different variations.
Adjust the spice levels to suit your taste.
Bhajias are best enjoyed immediately while they are still hot and crispy. They make for a delightful snack during tea time or as a party appetizer.

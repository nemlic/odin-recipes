    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Chapati is a popular unleavened flatbread enjoyed in many parts of the world, including East Africa, India, and the Caribbean. Here's a simple recipe for making delicious chapatis:
    </p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup water (adjust as needed)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or melted ghee</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Additional flour for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough:<br>

            In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.
            Gradually add water while kneading the mixture. Continue adding water until a soft and pliable dough forms. The dough should not be too sticky or too dry.
            Add the vegetable oil or melted ghee to the dough, and knead for another 5-8 minutes until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Divide the Dough:<br>

            Divide the dough into golf ball-sized portions.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Roll Out the Chapatis:<br>

            On a lightly floured surface, take a dough ball and roll it into a thin, round disc. Aim for a thickness similar to a tortilla.
            If you prefer a circular shape, rotate the disc as you roll. The goal is to achieve an even thickness.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Cook on a Griddle or Pan:<br>

            Heat a griddle or non-stick pan over medium-high heat.
            Place the rolled chapati on the hot griddle and cook for about 1-2 minutes or until small bubbles start to form.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Flip and Cook:<br>

            Flip the chapati and cook the other side for an additional 1-2 minutes or until golden brown spots appear. You can press down gently with a spatula to help the chapati puff up.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Repeat:<br>

            Repeat the rolling and cooking process for the remaining dough balls.</li><br><br>
        <li>Keep Warm:<br>

            As each chapati is done, you can stack them on a plate and cover with a kitchen towel to keep them warm.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>Serve:<br>

            Serve the chapatis warm with your favorite curry, stew, or side dishes.
        </li><br><br>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Adjust the amount of water as needed to achieve the right consistency for the dough.
For extra fluffiness, you can let the dough rest for about 30 minutes before rolling out the chapatis.
Experiment with using whole wheat flour or a mix of flours for a different flavor.
Chapatis are versatile and can be enjoyed with various dishes or fillings. They are a staple in many cuisines and are relatively easy to make at home.
